# SCSC-ML-Presentation-20171011
My presentation given to SCSC on 11 October 2017

## About
In the presentation, I demonstrated various concepts relating to
machine learning and artificial intelligence. I approached various
algorithms, and gave several demos, which are available in this
repository. A couple are in separate repositories, and have been
added as submodules.

## How to use
Each of the demos has an info guide on how to use them. Just run
with no arguments or with help as the only argument to get information.

## Credits
The implementation of the Monte Carlo tree algorithm is based heavily
on an implementation by [Jeff Bradberry](https://github.com/jbradberry/mcts).
The images and video I showed in my live demo are identifiable via watermarks.
